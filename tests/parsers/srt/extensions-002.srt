1
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:28,171  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Well, why don't you show me
this so-called proposal?

2
00:01:33,054 --> 00:01:37,787  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Okay, I'll show you my proposal!

3
00:01:59,013 --> 00:02:05,885  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Here it is! This is the completed
version of my proposal!

4
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,736  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
How do you like it?

5
00:03:11,185 --> 00:03:13,346  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
What is that?

6
00:03:17,258 --> 00:03:18,282  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
It's...

7
00:03:28,169 --> 00:03:33,674  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
You jerk!

8
00:03:33,674 --> 00:03:37,838  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Momma, it's weird! It's strange!

9
00:03:39,446 --> 00:03:41,048  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Don't point!

10
00:03:41,048 --> 00:03:43,278  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
But that weird thing is really weird.

11
00:03:44,585 --> 00:03:47,121  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
But it's really, really strange!

12
00:03:47,121 --> 00:03:48,956  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
You can't say so just because
it's the truth!

13
00:03:48,956 --> 00:03:50,424  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
She's right, kid.

14
00:03:50,424 --> 00:03:53,027  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
If you pay attention to something like
that, the weirdness will rub off on you.

15
00:03:53,027 --> 00:03:54,161  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
That's right!

16
00:03:54,161 --> 00:03:55,896  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
But it's strange!

17
00:03:55,896 --> 00:03:58,065  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Everybody knows it's strange.

18
00:03:58,065 --> 00:03:59,400  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Yes, he's right!

19
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,563  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
But you can't say it out loud because
she might hear you.

20
00:04:03,604 --> 00:04:05,868  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Dragon Slave!

21
00:04:08,943 --> 00:04:11,207  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Dragon Slave!

22
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,271  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Dragon Slave!

23
00:04:18,819 --> 00:04:21,021  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Mistress Lina?

24
00:04:21,021 --> 00:04:22,488  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Mistress Lina!

25
00:04:24,758 --> 00:04:26,927  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
What do you think of it?

26
00:04:26,927 --> 00:04:27,795  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
How do you...

27
00:04:27,795 --> 00:04:28,429  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
*Your offer is*
How do you...

28
00:04:28,429 --> 00:04:29,563  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
*Your offer is*

29
00:04:29,563 --> 00:04:31,531  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
*absolutely rejected and denied*
*from the beginning!*

30
00:04:33,834 --> 00:04:40,140  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Why? Didn't you say you would
cooperate with my proposal?

31
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:42,870  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
This proposal is a completely
different story!

32
00:04:47,181 --> 00:04:50,217  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
The wings of a dragon,
the neck of a sea serpent,

33
00:04:50,217 --> 00:04:55,422  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
a blast demon's body and your head:
the Super Chimera!

34
00:04:55,422 --> 00:04:57,583  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I'm sure you'll have more fun this way!

35
00:05:01,295 --> 00:05:03,697  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Even if you use a copy of me,

36
00:05:03,697 --> 00:05:08,134  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
it would really bother me to see a
Chimera walking around with my face!

37
00:05:09,436 --> 00:05:10,971  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Don't worry.

38
00:05:10,971 --> 00:05:15,542  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I'm going to use you, not a copy.

39
00:05:15,542 --> 00:05:18,712  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Is that so? Well, in that case...

40
00:05:18,712 --> 00:05:20,543  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
That's even worse!

41
00:05:31,292 --> 00:05:35,763  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
You snuck out by yourself while
I was taking my beauty rest.

42
00:05:35,763 --> 00:05:40,401  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I guess you are plotting to steal
someone's treasure,

43
00:05:40,401 --> 00:05:43,859  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
but I won't let you do so, Lina lnverse!

44
00:05:45,606 --> 00:05:48,242  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
So, you finally woke up,
you perverted magic user.

45
00:05:48,242 --> 00:05:50,506  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Who are you calling a perverted
magic user?

46
00:05:51,612 --> 00:05:53,480  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
What's that?

47
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:59,680  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Oh, well, I was asking her to cooperate
with me to create a creature like this.

48
00:06:02,623 --> 00:06:05,251  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
It's so cool!

49
00:06:09,897 --> 00:06:12,499  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I like your idea and I'm
going to help you.

50
00:06:12,499 --> 00:06:15,969  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Wait! What are you thinking, Naga?!

51
00:06:15,969 --> 00:06:18,339  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
You're still a little kid,
aren't you, Lina?

52
00:06:18,339 --> 00:06:21,442  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
You don't understand this design
which is full of functional beauty.

53
00:06:21,442 --> 00:06:22,704  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Exactly!

54
00:06:27,114 --> 00:06:29,082  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Mono Bolt!

55
00:06:31,852 --> 00:06:33,820  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Followed by Black Occult Blast!

56
00:06:36,156 --> 00:06:38,215  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Explosion Array!

57
00:06:51,171 --> 00:06:53,540  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Hey, Lina.

58
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,743  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
We wasted it, didn't we?

59
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,244  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Wasted what?

60
00:06:57,244 --> 00:07:01,048  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
The plan to make you into a Chimera.

61
00:07:01,048 --> 00:07:04,885  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Excuse me Naga, but it
was a month ago.

62
00:07:04,885 --> 00:07:07,521  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I'd finally started to forget
that incident.

63
00:07:07,521 --> 00:07:11,725  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I won't let you forget it.

64
00:07:11,725 --> 00:07:17,765  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Listen, who was it that blasted
me along with that old man?

65
00:07:17,765 --> 00:07:21,326  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
It was an accident.

66
00:07:23,804 --> 00:07:26,740  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Are you Lina lnverse?

67
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,308  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
That's me all right.

68
00:07:28,308 --> 00:07:30,911  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I want you to come with us without
asking any questions.

69
00:07:30,911 --> 00:07:33,046  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
What are you going to do if I say no?

70
00:07:33,046 --> 00:07:34,848  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Do you mean to take me
with you by force?

71
00:07:34,848 --> 00:07:36,247  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I guess that's what we'll do.

72
00:07:38,919 --> 00:07:42,556  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
You're very brave to ignore me.

73
00:07:42,556 --> 00:07:44,057  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Who the hell are you?

74
00:07:44,057 --> 00:07:45,058  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Now!

75
00:07:45,058 --> 00:07:46,423  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Explosion Array!

76
00:07:53,267 --> 00:07:56,603  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Now, you're the only one left,
aren't you?

77
00:07:56,603 --> 00:07:58,264  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Impossible!

78
00:08:00,774 --> 00:08:04,144  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I can't believe you'd involve your
companion in the blast!

79
00:08:04,144 --> 00:08:07,014  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Naga will be fine, really.

80
00:08:07,014 --> 00:08:09,175  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Really, you say?

81
00:08:15,856 --> 00:08:20,623  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I hope you don't think you'll make it
home unharmed after crossing me.

82
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,102  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I guess I escaped from her somehow.

83
00:08:29,102 --> 00:08:29,703  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
*Hello?*
I guess I escaped from her somehow.

84
00:08:29,703 --> 00:08:31,338  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
*Hello?*

85
00:08:31,338 --> 00:08:32,566  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Hi!

86
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:36,844  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
You're a ghost!

87
00:08:36,844 --> 00:08:38,345  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
That's not a very polite thing to say.

88
00:08:38,345 --> 00:08:42,583  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I've just been following you from
the air while you were running.

89
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:43,777  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Well, let's see now.

90
00:08:49,389 --> 00:08:52,192  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Oh, no! That voice is...

91
00:08:52,192 --> 00:08:59,066  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
They were pretty good, but they
couldn't handle you, could they?

92
00:08:59,066 --> 00:09:02,970  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
It's okay. Get out of here now!

93
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:05,405  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Thank you very much!

94
00:09:05,405 --> 00:09:09,243  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Long time no see, Lina lnverse.

95
00:09:09,243 --> 00:09:13,514  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Just as I thought, you're that Chimera
manic, old man Diol.

96
00:09:13,514 --> 00:09:14,815  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
That's correct.

97
00:09:14,815 --> 00:09:17,184  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Haven't you learned your lesson yet?

98
00:09:17,184 --> 00:09:21,455  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Your strength is certainly
what caught my eye.

99
00:09:21,455 --> 00:09:25,824  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
However, with these guys it
will be a different story!

100
00:09:42,709 --> 00:09:45,412  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
You've raised some interesting
points, haven't you?

101
00:09:45,412 --> 00:09:48,682  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
What kind of technique did you use?

102
00:09:48,682 --> 00:09:52,686  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Are you familiar with
"Copy Homonuclus"?

103
00:09:52,686 --> 00:09:55,522  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
The making of a golem by
mixing animal bones,

104
00:09:55,522 --> 00:09:58,425  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
magical herbs and human
blood, isn't it?

105
00:09:58,425 --> 00:10:00,060  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Exactly.

106
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:03,864  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I've taken those methods
one step further.

107
00:10:03,864 --> 00:10:10,871  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
With Copy Homunculus for example,
I made it easier.

108
00:10:10,871 --> 00:10:18,078  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I can create a golem using just a
strand of hair or a finger nail.

109
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:21,882  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Add to this the fact that you've
been to my lab before.

110
00:10:21,882 --> 00:10:25,841  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
It was not so difficult for me to find
one of your hairs on the floor.

111
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,122  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I see, I see.

112
00:10:29,122 --> 00:10:30,924  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Wait a second!

113
00:10:30,924 --> 00:10:34,361  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I guess he made ten copies of me.

114
00:10:34,361 --> 00:10:38,765  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
However, even though he can make
a copy with my abilities,

115
00:10:38,765 --> 00:10:42,369  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I don't think he can copy my memories,
experiences or techniques.

116
00:10:42,369 --> 00:10:45,998  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
That means they can't use my magic.

117
00:10:46,106 --> 00:10:52,813  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
If you think using them will help
you win, bring them on!

118
00:10:52,813 --> 00:10:56,943  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Well, I guess I will. Everybody!

119
00:11:34,154 --> 00:11:36,019  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
What are these?!

120
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,845  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Lina...

121
00:12:07,888 --> 00:12:10,724  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
There's one missing.

122
00:12:10,724 --> 00:12:16,396  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I guess she caught him and forced
him to buy her a meal.

123
00:12:16,396 --> 00:12:18,660  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Lina's so spoiled!

124
00:12:24,905 --> 00:12:26,873  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
It's that laughing sound again.

125
00:12:28,008 --> 00:12:30,410  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Mom, I'm scared.

126
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:32,879  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Scary, so scary!

127
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:37,441  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Please, please, please, please...

128
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:44,024  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Looking good, Lina lnverse.

129
00:12:44,024 --> 00:12:47,527  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
She looks just like a little girl when
she's sleeping like this.

130
00:12:47,527 --> 00:12:51,465  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Your band of thieves was ruined
by that little girl, wasn't it?

131
00:12:51,465 --> 00:12:52,733  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Are you trying to be sarcastic?

132
00:12:52,733 --> 00:12:55,135  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Ah, no. What I meant was

133
00:12:55,135 --> 00:12:58,772  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I don't want you to be violent with her
even though you harbor a grudge.

134
00:12:58,772 --> 00:13:04,211  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
This girl, Lina lnverse, is necessary
material for my project.

135
00:13:04,211 --> 00:13:06,780  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I know that. You've told me
so again and again.

136
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:09,116  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
That's why I'm here.

137
00:13:09,116 --> 00:13:12,252  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
And why you became my
sponsor, right?

138
00:13:12,252 --> 00:13:14,755  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
You've said that again and
again, Lord Vista.

139
00:13:14,755 --> 00:13:17,958  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Anyway, Master Diol, let's move
her to our base quickly,

140
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:20,560  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
so we can create the Chimera.

141
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,395  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Well, why don't you slow
down a little bit?

142
00:13:22,395 --> 00:13:25,499  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
There are still a few other
things I need to collect.

143
00:13:25,499 --> 00:13:28,059  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I see. I don't care what they are,
just tell me what you need.

144
00:13:29,903 --> 00:13:32,005  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Okay, then I need you to get me

145
00:13:32,005 --> 00:13:35,275  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
a brass demon, a red dragon,
and a Serpent of the Deep.

146
00:13:35,275 --> 00:13:36,742  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
One of each, please.

147
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:43,784  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I wonder if you have any of the
necessary materials at all?

148
00:13:43,784 --> 00:13:45,886  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Let me ask you something,
young man.

149
00:13:45,886 --> 00:13:53,850  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Which is more difficult: capturing a
dragon, a demon or Lina lnverse?

150
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:08,137  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
By the way, old man, what are you
going to do with those others?

151
00:14:10,143 --> 00:14:13,880  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
The only thing they can do is laugh
loudly and give people headaches.

152
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:18,340  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
They eat and drink like horses. I can't
say my meal tickets have been light.

153
00:14:19,886 --> 00:14:22,855  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
That's all very well, but...

154
00:14:25,992 --> 00:14:32,227  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
It was most embarrassing for me to
order their outfits from the shop.

155
00:14:36,937 --> 00:14:39,172  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Have you seen this girl?

156
00:14:39,172 --> 00:14:41,402  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
No, I haven't.

157
00:14:45,111 --> 00:14:49,349  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
You've become even trickier and
more elaborate, Lina lnverse.

158
00:14:49,349 --> 00:14:51,351  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
However!

159
00:14:51,351 --> 00:14:55,117  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
You're kidding yourself if you
think this will confuse me!

160
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:58,592  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
She's started again!

161
00:14:58,592 --> 00:15:00,059  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Help me!

162
00:15:02,762 --> 00:15:05,731  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Please, please, please...

163
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:09,736  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
You where the one I heard laughing
like a horse this evening.

164
00:15:09,736 --> 00:15:12,305  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Please leave now. You don't
need to pay for anything.

165
00:15:12,305 --> 00:15:16,605  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
A genius is always unappreciated
in her own day.

166
00:15:33,293 --> 00:15:34,988  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Hey, Master Diol!

167
00:15:36,062 --> 00:15:38,331  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Why are you being so noisy?

168
00:15:38,331 --> 00:15:41,635  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Word just arrived that the woman
called Naga has arrived in Midas,

169
00:15:41,635 --> 00:15:43,865  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
and has been making inquiries.

170
00:15:45,305 --> 00:15:47,007  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I see.

171
00:15:47,007 --> 00:15:49,669  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I'll take care of it.

172
00:15:52,178 --> 00:15:54,948  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Long time no see, but I don't
remember your name.

173
00:15:54,948 --> 00:15:56,349  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I'm Diol.

174
00:15:56,349 --> 00:16:02,310  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I'm sorry to call you out like this, but
I can't return Lina lnverse to you.

175
00:16:03,523 --> 00:16:05,825  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
You're wasting time if you think
talking that way

176
00:16:05,825 --> 00:16:07,928  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
will keep me away from
your sweet deal!

177
00:16:07,928 --> 00:16:09,529  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I wonder if you're right or not?

178
00:16:09,529 --> 00:16:13,867  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
All the materials for my Chimera
will be ready shortly.

179
00:16:13,867 --> 00:16:19,134  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Then, the strongest Super Chimera
ever will be born!

180
00:16:23,043 --> 00:16:25,145  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Don't make me laugh.

181
00:16:25,145 --> 00:16:28,648  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
No matter what happens, I won't let
Lina cut me out of a free meal.

182
00:16:28,648 --> 00:16:32,285  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I don't think they understand
what they're talking about.

183
00:16:32,285 --> 00:16:34,854  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Neither of them seem to
care though, do they?

184
00:16:34,854 --> 00:16:38,258  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I see. If you really want Lina
lnverse back that badly,

185
00:16:38,258 --> 00:16:40,060  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
you'll have to kill me first.

186
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:43,463  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
But you have to know it won't be easy!

187
00:16:43,463 --> 00:16:45,021  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Everybody!

188
00:17:29,776 --> 00:17:31,945  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
How's that?

189
00:17:31,945 --> 00:17:34,781  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
You're kidding yourself.

190
00:17:34,781 --> 00:17:36,916  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
You ten copies over there!

191
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:40,253  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Your laughing voices only copy
the surface of my laugh.

192
00:17:40,253 --> 00:17:43,416  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Do you really think you can take
over the world that way?

193
00:17:45,325 --> 00:17:49,262  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
A supreme sense of superiority
and extreme self-confidence!

194
00:17:49,262 --> 00:17:51,931  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
My laugh can't be copied
without these.

195
00:17:51,931 --> 00:17:53,833  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Since you don't have those qualities,

196
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:56,996  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
it will be over ten years before
you can laugh like me.

197
00:18:11,818 --> 00:18:14,184  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I can't take it any longer!

198
00:18:35,742 --> 00:18:37,877  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Oh, my God!

199
00:18:37,877 --> 00:18:40,547  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
What's the matter with you?

200
00:18:40,547 --> 00:18:42,615  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
That woman, Naga,

201
00:18:42,615 --> 00:18:47,075  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
she might be even more fearful
than Lina lnverse!

202
00:18:48,321 --> 00:18:49,889  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
What do you mean?

203
00:18:49,889 --> 00:18:55,225  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
The copies I created, the copies
of her, MY copies...

204
00:18:57,297 --> 00:18:59,032  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
They lost against the real one?

205
00:18:59,032 --> 00:19:01,301  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
No, no, no! No!

206
00:19:01,301 --> 00:19:02,859  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
They became attached to her.

207
00:19:11,077 --> 00:19:14,046  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
They became attached to her?

208
00:19:33,366 --> 00:19:34,924  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
It's the whole group!

209
00:20:24,884 --> 00:20:27,250  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Demonic Crystal!

210
00:21:36,556 --> 00:21:39,459  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Finally, I have found you, Lina lnverse!

211
00:21:39,459 --> 00:21:42,962  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I can't believe you hired strange guys
and tried to stop me

212
00:21:42,962 --> 00:21:45,932  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
in order to keep the sweet
deal to yourself!

213
00:21:45,932 --> 00:21:51,700  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
However, if you think you can get rid
of me that way, you're still a child.

214
00:21:57,176 --> 00:22:00,980  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Hey, you, you don't listen
to me at all, do you?

215
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:05,178  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
You didn't think taking sleeping pills
would make me give up, did you?

216
00:22:09,222 --> 00:22:10,951  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
De-toxify!

217
00:22:19,265 --> 00:22:21,529  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Are you awake now, Lina?

218
00:22:25,838 --> 00:22:27,774  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Hey, Lina?

219
00:22:27,774 --> 00:22:32,645  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
She's gone again. I guess she's
not mentally strong enough.

220
00:22:32,645 --> 00:22:33,880  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I have no choice now.

221
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,849  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Hey, you girls, why don't you hide your
faces with your cloaks or something?

222
00:22:38,484 --> 00:22:40,679  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Lina! Hey, Lina!

223
00:22:43,756 --> 00:22:44,724  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Naga?

224
00:22:44,724 --> 00:22:45,258  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
*What do you mean, "Naga"? You're*
*not totally awake yet, are you?*
Naga?

225
00:22:45,258 --> 00:22:49,629  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
*What do you mean, "Naga"? You're*
*not totally awake yet, are you?*

226
00:22:49,629 --> 00:22:53,087  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Yeah, I had a strange dream
or something.

227
00:22:58,404 --> 00:23:00,540  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
It wasn't a dream.

228
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:02,642  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I guess you're fully awake now.

229
00:23:02,642 --> 00:23:05,244  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I already know that you hired
someone to stop me

230
00:23:05,244 --> 00:23:08,014  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
in order to keep a sweet
deal all to yourself.

231
00:23:08,014 --> 00:23:11,651  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Admit your guilt and let
me share in the deal!

232
00:23:11,651 --> 00:23:16,155  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Excuse me, but what kind of
nonsense are you spouting?

233
00:23:16,155 --> 00:23:19,859  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I was captured by a magic user
and held here.

234
00:23:19,859 --> 00:23:23,763  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
You know, old man Diol,
the Chimera maniac?

235
00:23:23,763 --> 00:23:26,532  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Do you really think I'll believe
such a stupid excuse?

236
00:23:26,532 --> 00:23:28,935  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
It's not an excuse, it's true!

237
00:23:28,935 --> 00:23:33,039  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I fainted after seeing ten of
you lined up together.

238
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,743  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
It's really nothing but an excuse.

239
00:23:36,743 --> 00:23:40,702  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
There isn't a human alive who would
faint because of something like that.

240
00:23:44,917 --> 00:23:46,519  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Damn, in this case...

241
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:50,156  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Naga, that old man, Diol, tricked
us and he's going to

242
00:23:50,156 --> 00:23:53,092  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
eat delicious things while we fight.

243
00:23:53,092 --> 00:23:55,495  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I thought so.

244
00:23:55,495 --> 00:23:57,697  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Listen, Lina and I are going
to chase the two of them.

245
00:23:57,697 --> 00:23:59,899  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Wait for us in Midas. Okay?

246
00:23:59,899 --> 00:24:01,901  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Say, won't the town be in a panic?

247
00:24:01,901 --> 00:24:05,064  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Don't worry. I'm sure they've
been immunized by now.

248
00:24:06,973 --> 00:24:10,676  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
We swam so far I guess we'll be okay.
Right, Master Diol?

249
00:24:10,676 --> 00:24:11,778  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Damn.

250
00:24:11,778 --> 00:24:12,779  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
What's the matter?

251
00:24:12,779 --> 00:24:16,783  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Lina, I left Lina lnverse back there.

252
00:24:16,783 --> 00:24:19,752  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
We didn't have time to bring
her with us, did we?

253
00:24:19,752 --> 00:24:21,821  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
You're right.

254
00:24:21,821 --> 00:24:24,457  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
However, even though she'll sleep
for another half a day,

255
00:24:24,457 --> 00:24:27,693  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
if they get together with Lina
after she recovers,

256
00:24:27,693 --> 00:24:29,786  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
it could cause serious trouble.

257
00:24:31,898 --> 00:24:34,924  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
You're already in serious trouble.

258
00:24:37,537 --> 00:24:41,541  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Good morning, Master Diol.
By the way, who are you?

259
00:24:41,541 --> 00:24:43,543  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I have no other choice now!

260
00:24:43,543 --> 00:24:47,980  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I'm Lord Vista, sponsor of this
old man's Chimera Plan.

261
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:53,853  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I was the leader of the brigand gang
Boizun, which you ruined.

262
00:24:53,853 --> 00:24:57,380  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I had a beard at that time, so you
might not recognize me.

263
00:25:03,596 --> 00:25:07,266  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
That's why you tried to
take revenge on me.

264
00:25:07,266 --> 00:25:08,426  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Isn't it?

265
00:25:09,469 --> 00:25:11,304  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Exactly.

266
00:25:11,304 --> 00:25:14,941  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Listen, don't even think that
you can defeat me now.

267
00:25:14,941 --> 00:25:16,476  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Now that I'm serious, I will...

268
00:25:16,476 --> 00:25:18,444  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Explosion Array!

269
00:25:20,413 --> 00:25:23,516  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Damn, I can't believe there are young
girls like her in this day and time.

270
00:25:23,516 --> 00:25:26,285  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
She attacked us in the
middle of your line!

271
00:25:26,285 --> 00:25:30,189  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
What kind of girl doesn't have
any morals or loveliness?!

272
00:25:30,189 --> 00:25:32,258  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Mega Brand!

273
00:25:32,258 --> 00:25:34,927  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Sorry!

274
00:25:34,927 --> 00:25:40,092  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I'm sorry. It's all our fault!

275
00:25:41,701 --> 00:25:47,173  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Well, let's take these two to the
federal office and get the reward.

276
00:25:47,173 --> 00:25:51,377  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
We can't leave such a crazy old
man running around free.

277
00:25:51,377 --> 00:25:54,346  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I'll finally be able to eat
delicious food, right?

278
00:25:57,817 --> 00:26:03,022  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
By the way, Naga, why are
those ten still with you?

279
00:26:03,022 --> 00:26:06,092  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
It's obvious. It's my natural virtue.

280
00:26:06,092 --> 00:26:08,928  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I see, whatever you say.

281
00:26:08,928 --> 00:26:12,098  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Well, what are you going
to do about them?

282
00:26:12,098 --> 00:26:14,100  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Just pay them no mind.

283
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,701  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Excuse me, but...

284
00:26:15,701 --> 00:26:19,372  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Are you worrying about how
much they'll cost us?

285
00:26:19,372 --> 00:26:22,739  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
You're so narrow minded, Lina lnverse!

286
00:26:39,926 --> 00:26:41,689  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Somebody, please stop them.

287
00:27:24,804 --> 00:27:36,849  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I don't know what to decide to do,
I picture empty skies in my dreams

288
00:27:36,849 --> 00:27:43,122  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Why do we fight?

289
00:27:43,122 --> 00:27:48,661  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Why do we get hurt?

290
00:27:48,661 --> 00:27:59,171  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
The dream that I hold in my arms

291
00:27:59,171 --> 00:28:02,575  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Sometimes becomes heavy

292
00:28:02,575 --> 00:28:15,021  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Happiness is the ecstasy
that everyone wants

293
00:28:15,021 --> 00:28:28,067  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
They covet it and get it,
but still want more

294
00:28:28,067 --> 00:28:35,107  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
If you have a limitless desire

295
00:28:35,107 --> 00:28:41,213  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
you can regain your footing

296
00:28:41,213 --> 00:28:47,520  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
If you want happiness is

297
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:55,052  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
The only thing you can
do is to keep walking

298
00:29:07,106 --> 00:29:14,013  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Some sacrifices are
impossible to discuss

299
00:29:14,013 --> 00:29:20,352  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Within a limitless desire

300
00:29:20,352 --> 00:29:26,625  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
If you have passion and bravery

301
00:29:26,625 --> 00:29:34,794  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
The only thing you can do
is keep walking

302
00:32:32,878 --> 00:32:36,482  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
You said you want us to
make Jeffrey a man,

303
00:32:36,482 --> 00:32:40,748  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
but even though Naga dresses this
way, our business isn't like that.

304
00:32:43,522 --> 00:32:45,824  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Oh, my God, what are
you talking about?

305
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:49,295  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Who would ask to do such a thing
to my lovely Jeffrey?!

306
00:32:49,295 --> 00:32:52,131  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Well, first of all, my son Jeffrey is,

307
00:32:52,131 --> 00:32:56,235  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
this might sound like I'm boasting
since I'm his mother,

308
00:32:56,235 --> 00:33:01,040  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
but he listens to me all the time,
and is a very good boy.

309
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:04,009  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
He's grown up very upright, and
I'm extremely proud of him.

310
00:33:04,009 --> 00:33:07,446  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
As the heir of the noble
Mailstar family,

311
00:33:07,446 --> 00:33:11,450  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
how should I say this, he is a man
descended from noble blood,

312
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:14,987  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
he is overflowing with natural
talents that can't be hidden

313
00:33:14,987 --> 00:33:16,455  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
no matter what one does.

314
00:33:16,455 --> 00:33:19,458  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Anyway, as his mother, it's natural
for me to think about him

315
00:33:19,458 --> 00:33:23,429  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
and, considering my lovely
Jeffery's talents

316
00:33:23,429 --> 00:33:25,731  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
and being true to the name
of the Mailstars,

317
00:33:25,731 --> 00:33:28,901  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
want to find him a suitable job.

318
00:33:28,901 --> 00:33:32,304  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
So I used my special channels
to gather information

319
00:33:32,304 --> 00:33:34,840  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
and considered the question
thoroughly.

320
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:40,579  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Since my family comes from a
long lineage of great knights,

321
00:33:40,579 --> 00:33:46,752  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I decided it would be natural for
him to join the Royal Guard.

322
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:53,325  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Well, some other ladies may
feel that it's too natural,

323
00:33:53,325 --> 00:33:57,129  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
but no matter what other ladies say,

324
00:33:57,129 --> 00:34:01,759  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I believe that becoming a knight is the
most suitable course for my Jeffery.

325
00:34:10,743 --> 00:34:12,404  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
This isn't a bad job.

326
00:34:15,514 --> 00:34:17,141  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Excuse me...

327
00:34:21,286 --> 00:34:25,222  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Hello, I'm Jeffery Mailstar.

328
00:34:40,039 --> 00:34:45,204  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Well, our business is to help you
become a member of the Royal Guard.

329
00:34:47,546 --> 00:34:53,852  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Yes, my mama told me to help
you subjugate bad people.

330
00:34:53,852 --> 00:34:55,154  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Mama...

331
00:34:55,154 --> 00:34:58,021  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Your mama said?!

332
00:34:59,091 --> 00:35:02,094  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I know that the "bad people"
we're going to subjugate

333
00:35:02,094 --> 00:35:05,297  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
are actors hired by that woman, but...

334
00:35:05,297 --> 00:35:09,631  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
It's too late, Lina. We accepted
the payment in advance.

335
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:16,840  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Well, we need to discuss how to go
about that. How is your skill at...

336
00:35:20,145 --> 00:35:22,981  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Oops, I wonder if she might
have seen me?

337
00:35:22,981 --> 00:35:25,484  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Is there anything wrong, Ms. Lina?

338
00:35:25,484 --> 00:35:28,554  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
No, no, nothing, nothing.
Don't worry about me.

339
00:35:28,554 --> 00:35:31,557  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Anyway, we would like to know what

340
00:35:31,557 --> 00:35:34,860  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
practical skills you have
before we do anything.

341
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:36,862  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Please let yourself be relieved.

342
00:35:36,862 --> 00:35:38,997  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
No matter what kind of enemies
appear in front of us,

343
00:35:38,997 --> 00:35:41,567  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I will kill them all just as
fast as they appear!

344
00:35:41,567 --> 00:35:45,504  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I understand that you've never
fought in any real battles.

345
00:35:45,504 --> 00:35:48,273  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
So, where does your confidence
come from?

346
00:35:48,273 --> 00:35:49,740  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
It's obvious!

347
00:35:53,946 --> 00:35:56,710  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Mama guaranteed my success

348
00:35:57,816 --> 00:36:00,250  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
by saying, "You'll be fine!"

349
00:36:03,655 --> 00:36:06,425  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
You're kidding yourself, boy.

350
00:36:06,425 --> 00:36:08,985  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
No matter what your mother
told you, clumsy is clum...

351
00:36:10,229 --> 00:36:13,265  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I won't let anybody say bad things
about my lovely Jeffery!

352
00:36:13,265 --> 00:36:17,269  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
My Jeffery's skill with a
sword is outstanding!

353
00:36:17,269 --> 00:36:20,472  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Excuse me, but are you...

354
00:36:20,472 --> 00:36:25,677  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Oh, my! Don't pay any attention to me!

355
00:36:25,677 --> 00:36:28,043  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I'm just a stranger walking by.

356
00:36:34,219 --> 00:36:38,178  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I guess she was just walking by.

357
00:36:39,825 --> 00:36:43,028  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Are you serious?

358
00:36:43,028 --> 00:36:46,064  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
It's always been a very common
incident, happens all the time.

359
00:36:46,064 --> 00:36:50,433  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
A masked pedestrian appears and
beats the hell out of someone.

360
00:36:53,238 --> 00:36:55,807  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
It doesn't normally happen that way.

361
00:36:55,807 --> 00:37:01,336  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Really? Perhaps it's a local custom.

362
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:06,515  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
No way...

363
00:37:07,953 --> 00:37:09,922  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
We're close to the thieves' hide-out.

364
00:37:09,922 --> 00:37:12,524  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Jeffery, what plan of attack
would you use?

365
00:37:12,524 --> 00:37:14,651  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Well, if it was my plan...

366
00:37:16,962 --> 00:37:20,699  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
First, I'd introduce myself, and
begin a frontal assault.

367
00:37:20,699 --> 00:37:25,604  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I'd kill small fry one after another, and
march onward like a great angry wave.

368
00:37:25,604 --> 00:37:28,941  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I'd use my quick wits to rescue
the hostage, you Ms. Lina.

369
00:37:28,941 --> 00:37:32,900  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Finally, I would kill their leader,
and become a celebrity!

370
00:37:34,246 --> 00:37:36,148  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
How was that?

371
00:37:36,148 --> 00:37:38,250  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
You're asking me if it was a good plan?

372
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:43,222  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
It wasn't even a plan! It sounded
like a third-class minstrel's...

373
00:37:43,222 --> 00:37:46,385  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
What do you mean "third-class"?!

374
00:37:50,929 --> 00:37:55,389  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
My lovely Jeffery's plans
are never wrong!

375
00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:00,360  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
They can't be! Right?

376
00:38:03,075 --> 00:38:05,244  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Excuse me...

377
00:38:05,244 --> 00:38:09,476  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Don't worry about me. I'm just
a pedestrian walking by.

378
00:38:12,651 --> 00:38:17,055  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I didn't realize there were tourists
in places like this.

379
00:38:17,055 --> 00:38:19,819  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Are you really serious?

380
00:38:20,993 --> 00:38:23,154  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Is there anything wrong with that?

381
00:38:24,596 --> 00:38:25,927  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
No...

382
00:38:33,071 --> 00:38:35,335  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Hey, where are you going?

383
00:38:38,477 --> 00:38:41,513  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Are these the guys
Ms. Josephine hired?

384
00:38:41,513 --> 00:38:43,982  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
It's a nice casting job.

385
00:38:43,982 --> 00:38:48,248  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
There you are, you brigands!
Prepare yourselves!

386
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,091  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Damn...

387
00:39:13,245 --> 00:39:17,249  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
You jerks! You've caused
me such a struggle.

388
00:39:17,249 --> 00:39:19,615  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I'm sure you must be famous warriors!

389
00:39:20,886 --> 00:39:22,688  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
What a stupid joke!

390
00:39:22,688 --> 00:39:24,389  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
You clumsy fool!

391
00:39:24,389 --> 00:39:26,914  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Man, that's the wrong thing to say!

392
00:39:46,345 --> 00:39:49,872  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
What did you say to my lovely Jeffery?!

393
00:39:52,351 --> 00:39:57,456  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
You should let yourself be hit by my
Jeffrey's sword, just to be nice to him!

394
00:39:57,456 --> 00:40:00,158  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I thought so.

395
00:40:00,158 --> 00:40:04,424  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
For your information,
I'm just a pedestrian.

396
00:40:10,235 --> 00:40:13,898  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Well, when I become serious,

397
00:40:15,974 --> 00:40:18,442  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
this is the result.

398
00:40:20,445 --> 00:40:22,280  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Really?

399
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:25,841  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Well, let's go! The enemy's
hide-out is very close.

400
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:34,793  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Since you made it this far, I guess
the guards are finished, right?

401
00:40:34,793 --> 00:40:39,197  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Just in case though, did you
come to rescue them?

402
00:40:39,197 --> 00:40:40,599  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Them?

403
00:40:40,599 --> 00:40:41,657  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Yes.

404
00:40:42,834 --> 00:40:45,670  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
When I finally returned to this place
after an extended absence,

405
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:49,474  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
these small fry were pushing
everyone around.

406
00:40:49,474 --> 00:40:53,672  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I wonder if they're also actors
hired by Josephine?

407
00:40:54,813 --> 00:40:57,649  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
You do know them, don't you?

408
00:40:57,649 --> 00:41:04,222  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
First, let me ask you something.
Are you a real band of thieves?

409
00:41:04,222 --> 00:41:07,959  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Is there such thing as a
fake band of thieves?

410
00:41:07,959 --> 00:41:10,262  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Anyway, I don't think we can
let you go unharmed

411
00:41:10,262 --> 00:41:13,231  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
since you beat the hell out of
two of my followers.

412
00:41:13,231 --> 00:41:15,333  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Don't make me laugh!

413
00:41:15,333 --> 00:41:17,636  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I don't understand the detailed
background,

414
00:41:17,636 --> 00:41:20,906  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
but my trusty rapier will be more than
enough to deal with a wimp like you.

415
00:41:20,906 --> 00:41:22,464  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Prepare yourself!

416
00:41:25,343 --> 00:41:26,469  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Take this!

417
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:32,744  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Hey!

418
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:45,030  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
What's the matter? For such a
big mouth, you really stink!

419
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:46,164  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Those words!

420
00:41:46,164 --> 00:41:47,324  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
You shouldn't say things like that!

421
00:42:00,846 --> 00:42:01,904  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
What?

422
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:23,490  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
You said my Jeffery stunk,
and I won't forgive you!

423
00:42:34,646 --> 00:42:36,511  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
She's dead, isn't she?

424
00:42:40,519 --> 00:42:44,823  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
What do you think you were doing,
using a chain to catch me?!

425
00:42:44,823 --> 00:42:46,984  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
That was very dangerous!

426
00:42:50,161 --> 00:42:53,064  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
It's you, the pedestrian just walking!

427
00:42:53,064 --> 00:42:55,225  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
What is this monster?!

428
00:42:58,537 --> 00:43:01,199  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Oh, no! He drew blood!

429
00:43:02,641 --> 00:43:05,777  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I'm going to faint because I saw blood!

430
00:43:05,777 --> 00:43:07,938  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I'm so sensitive.

431
00:43:09,281 --> 00:43:11,182  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Me too.

432
00:43:11,182 --> 00:43:14,686  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Hey, what are you doing?

433
00:43:14,686 --> 00:43:19,558  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I don't really understand you,
but now you're the only one left.

434
00:43:19,558 --> 00:43:21,219  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Well, what are you going to do?

435
00:43:26,498 --> 00:43:29,729  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Explosion Array!

436
00:43:33,305 --> 00:43:35,273  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
What was that?

437
00:43:38,543 --> 00:43:40,345  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
What wimps!

438
00:43:40,345 --> 00:43:43,381  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
You didn't do anything!

439
00:43:43,381 --> 00:43:45,116  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I'm going to do it right now!

440
00:43:45,116 --> 00:43:47,243  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Freeze Arrow!

441
00:43:59,898 --> 00:44:02,434  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I won't lose so easily!

442
00:44:02,434 --> 00:44:03,602  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Oh, damn!

443
00:44:03,602 --> 00:44:05,537  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Listen, little girls!

444
00:44:05,537 --> 00:44:09,941  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
If you don't want to lose this kid,
cease your stupid struggling.

445
00:44:09,941 --> 00:44:11,643  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Naga, flank him.

446
00:44:11,643 --> 00:44:13,011  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Okay.

447
00:44:13,011 --> 00:44:15,714  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I said don't move! Don't move!

448
00:44:15,714 --> 00:44:19,517  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Do you want to know what
we're going to do now?

449
00:44:19,517 --> 00:44:23,421  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I said if you do something strange,
I'm going to kill him!

450
00:44:23,421 --> 00:44:25,523  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I'm going to show you now.

451
00:44:25,523 --> 00:44:28,583  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
She's going to take off
her clothes now!

452
00:44:30,629 --> 00:44:32,096  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
What?!

453
00:44:36,134 --> 00:44:37,795  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Come on...

454
00:44:41,172 --> 00:44:43,834  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Inverse Screw Crash!

455
00:44:56,187 --> 00:45:00,453  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Man, it's a sad living, isn't it?

456
00:45:10,101 --> 00:45:12,203  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Now you know, Jeffery.

457
00:45:12,203 --> 00:45:18,143  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Lina is exactly right. You're not cut
out for this kind of business at all.

458
00:45:18,143 --> 00:45:24,549  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Certainly, I'm just a beginner compared
to Ms. Lina and Ms. Naga.

459
00:45:24,549 --> 00:45:25,650  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
But!

460
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:29,177  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Even so, I understand that...

461
00:45:30,488 --> 00:45:34,686  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I understand that both of you say such
things because you envy my talent!

462
00:45:39,297 --> 00:45:43,501  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
However, however, l...

463
00:45:43,501 --> 00:45:45,059  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Because of this incident...

464
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:51,275  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I have absolute confidence
in myself now!

465
00:45:56,214 --> 00:45:59,517  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
By using my incredible talent,
which frightens even me,

466
00:45:59,517 --> 00:46:03,988  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I will someday claim the title
of Knight of Knights!

467
00:46:03,988 --> 00:46:07,559  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Are you listening to me?
Hey, Ms. Lina! Ms. Naga!

468
00:46:07,559 --> 00:46:10,824  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Ms. Lina, Ms Naga!

469
00:46:17,502 --> 00:46:21,840  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Actually, a man called the
Dark Knight sometimes appears,

470
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:24,109  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
and his is followed by uncountable
number of Orcs.

471
00:46:24,109 --> 00:46:26,577  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
They have robbed villages
and towns in this area.

472
00:46:27,912 --> 00:46:29,748  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Therefore, my mama told me,

473
00:46:29,748 --> 00:46:33,351  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
if I defeat this Dark Knight with my
overflowing talents and your support,

474
00:46:33,351 --> 00:46:36,955  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
she's sure that I would become
so popular that

475
00:46:36,955 --> 00:46:39,958  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
the Royal Guard would
want me to join them.

476
00:46:39,958 --> 00:46:41,092  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
With our...

477
00:46:41,092 --> 00:46:42,560  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Support?

478
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,528  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
You will accept our offer, won't you?

479
00:46:46,030 --> 00:46:49,467  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Is she a ghost or what?

480
00:46:49,467 --> 00:46:51,069  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
How about the idea?

481
00:46:51,069 --> 00:46:53,671  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Of course we'll accept it.

482
00:46:53,671 --> 00:46:55,907  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
It's too scary to refuse your offer.

483
00:46:55,907 --> 00:46:59,644  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Oh, I should have said we couldn't
be so unkind as to refuse.

484
00:46:59,644 --> 00:47:01,913  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Lord Jeffery!

485
00:47:01,913 --> 00:47:05,483  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
The Dark Knight has appeared.

486
00:47:05,483 --> 00:47:08,953  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Roger! Prepare to take
the field right now!

487
00:47:08,953 --> 00:47:10,011  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Yes, Sir.

488
00:47:14,726 --> 00:47:15,727  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
What was that?

489
00:47:15,727 --> 00:47:20,331  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
My mama hired a private
royal guard for me.

490
00:47:20,331 --> 00:47:21,733  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Private?

491
00:47:21,733 --> 00:47:22,995  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Royal guard?

492
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:43,288  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Who are you?

493
00:47:43,288 --> 00:47:44,622  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
It's obvious!

494
00:47:44,622 --> 00:47:49,394  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
We are the Golden Flame Knights,
gathered under the name of justice!

495
00:47:49,394 --> 00:47:52,463  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Hey, a name like that is
so embarrassing.

496
00:47:52,463 --> 00:47:55,567  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
You jerk, our king's land should
be holy and inviolable,

497
00:47:55,567 --> 00:47:59,771  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
but you've raped it with your dirty
feet and dastardly deeds!

498
00:47:59,771 --> 00:48:01,705  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Now, justice will...

499
00:48:04,275 --> 00:48:06,477  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Don't choke at a time like this.

500
00:48:06,477 --> 00:48:10,937  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Anyway, I'm going to kill
you so be prepared!

501
00:48:14,085 --> 00:48:16,610  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Are you ready! Charge!

502
00:48:39,911 --> 00:48:42,247  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
How stupid!

503
00:48:42,247 --> 00:48:44,549  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
You'll see whether they're stupid or not

504
00:48:44,549 --> 00:48:47,109  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
after you actually fight against them.

505
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:51,081  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Sounds interesting.

506
00:48:54,692 --> 00:48:56,294  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
The first victims are the orcs!

507
00:48:56,294 --> 00:48:57,695  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Got it!

508
00:48:57,695 --> 00:48:59,458  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Fire Ball!

509
00:49:03,868 --> 00:49:06,132  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Wind Bomb!

510
00:49:10,308 --> 00:49:12,877  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
You're magic users, aren't you?

511
00:49:12,877 --> 00:49:16,335  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Great job! I shouldn't underestimate
you even if you are women.

512
00:49:18,182 --> 00:49:20,241  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Bomb Split!

513
00:49:32,430 --> 00:49:38,102  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
This is it! This is the battle!
The real battle!

514
00:49:38,102 --> 00:49:39,763  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Freeze Crystal!

515
00:49:44,409 --> 00:49:47,276  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
That's because you talk too much!

516
00:50:00,091 --> 00:50:01,192  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
What?

517
00:50:01,192 --> 00:50:04,095  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I see. I understand.

518
00:50:04,095 --> 00:50:06,798  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
What do you understand?

519
00:50:06,798 --> 00:50:10,201  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Your armor is enchanted, isn't it?

520
00:50:10,201 --> 00:50:11,903  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Good guess.

521
00:50:11,903 --> 00:50:17,208  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I figure it's probably it's the
Enchantment of Valmashied.

522
00:50:17,208 --> 00:50:22,313  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
It's very expensive to use that curse,

523
00:50:22,313 --> 00:50:26,784  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
therefore, I'm sure you have some
kind of big sponsor behind you.

524
00:50:26,784 --> 00:50:28,786  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
You're pretty clever, aren't you?

525
00:50:28,786 --> 00:50:34,392  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Tell me who your sponsor is,
and what you're plotting.

526
00:50:34,392 --> 00:50:39,330  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I have no idea what my
sponsor is thinking.

527
00:50:39,330 --> 00:50:42,900  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
The only thing I'm interested
in is strength in battle.

528
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:45,470  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
If you want to me to answer
your question,

529
00:50:45,470 --> 00:50:47,529  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
you have to win the battle against me.

530
00:50:48,906 --> 00:50:50,066  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
All right then.

531
00:50:53,611 --> 00:50:55,579  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Chance!

532
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:02,780  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Who is this idiot?

533
00:51:04,022 --> 00:51:06,547  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Did you just say "idiot"?!

534
00:51:08,259 --> 00:51:12,897  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Ms. Josephine, where did
you come from?

535
00:51:12,897 --> 00:51:15,700  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I didn't feel any trace of her presence.

536
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:18,803  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
That woman is very high level.

537
00:51:18,803 --> 00:51:21,906  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Anyway, you are extremely rude!

538
00:51:21,906 --> 00:51:26,210  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
How can you call my
Jeffery an "idiot"?!

539
00:51:26,210 --> 00:51:28,179  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Shut up!

540
00:51:28,179 --> 00:51:31,239  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
What's wrong with calling
an idiot an idiot?!

541
00:51:45,096 --> 00:51:46,859  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
You still want to talk like that?

542
00:51:58,176 --> 00:51:59,473  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
This mouth says...

543
00:52:06,284 --> 00:52:07,842  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Ms. Josephine?

544
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:14,558  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
She went back to where she was.
I couldn't even see her movement.

545
00:52:23,234 --> 00:52:31,175  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
My name is Galda. Please let me
become your pupil, Ma'am.

546
00:52:31,175 --> 00:52:33,010  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Pupil?!

547
00:52:33,010 --> 00:52:37,882  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
In that case, you have to work
under my Jeffery.

548
00:52:37,882 --> 00:52:40,407  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Under this kid?

549
00:52:41,686 --> 00:52:44,388  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Under this what?

550
00:52:44,388 --> 00:52:47,391  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I'm so sorry, Teacher!

551
00:52:47,391 --> 00:52:49,427  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Now listen to me.

552
00:52:49,427 --> 00:52:53,090  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
You are going to work under
my Jeffery. Am I clear?

553
00:52:54,332 --> 00:52:56,234  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Yes, Ma'am!

554
00:52:56,234 --> 00:52:57,701  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
See you later.

555
00:53:24,795 --> 00:53:28,599  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Lord Goldias will probably
be over there.

556
00:53:28,599 --> 00:53:31,269  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
The sponsor you were talking about
before, right?

557
00:53:31,269 --> 00:53:33,171  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
We've finally got our fight.

558
00:53:33,171 --> 00:53:36,834  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I don't mind fighting, but what are
we going to do with Jeffery?

559
00:53:41,946 --> 00:53:45,049  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I know he'll only be trouble
if we bring him with us,

560
00:53:45,049 --> 00:53:47,985  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
but if I say something bad about
him, Ms. Josephine

561
00:53:47,985 --> 00:53:50,454  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
will come out and beat
the hell out of us.

562
00:53:50,454 --> 00:53:52,823  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I have an idea!

563
00:53:52,823 --> 00:53:55,793  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
The main character usually
appears last, doesn't he?

564
00:53:55,793 --> 00:53:58,996  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I'm sure it will be tough
for us without Jeffrey,

565
00:53:58,996 --> 00:54:06,562  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
but if we do our best, he will revive
like a phoenix and fly to our aid!

566
00:54:07,638 --> 00:54:11,442  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Good job, Lina. Your way of saying
that won't cause a problem.

567
00:54:11,442 --> 00:54:12,443  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Good!

568
00:54:12,443 --> 00:54:18,404  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Now, believing in Jeffrey's revival,
we'll leave him behind this pillar.

569
00:54:21,152 --> 00:54:23,211  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Now, let's go!

570
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:32,330  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I'm disappointed in you, Galda.

571
00:54:32,330 --> 00:54:37,535  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
However, your betrayal means that
someone defeated you in battle.

572
00:54:37,535 --> 00:54:41,471  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
There are some scary people
left in the world, aren't there?

573
00:54:43,374 --> 00:54:46,143  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Well, it's not a big deal.

574
00:54:46,143 --> 00:54:48,611  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Shall we start now?

575
00:55:10,868 --> 00:55:12,426  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Living Mail?

576
00:55:14,071 --> 00:55:17,336  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Exactly! Are you ready, Galda?

577
00:55:34,292 --> 00:55:36,093  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I have you, Galda!

578
00:55:36,093 --> 00:55:37,958  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Flare Arrow!

579
00:55:41,565 --> 00:55:42,657  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
So!

580
00:55:43,834 --> 00:55:46,737  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
This guy is really strong.

581
00:55:46,737 --> 00:55:50,875  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I'm going to help Galda by drawing
the Living Mail's attention.

582
00:55:50,875 --> 00:55:51,876  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Naga!

583
00:55:51,876 --> 00:55:52,910  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
What?

584
00:55:52,910 --> 00:55:55,746  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I won't forget you!

585
00:55:55,746 --> 00:55:57,714  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Go and die!

586
00:56:09,327 --> 00:56:12,558  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Now, everything will be
all right except Naga.

587
00:56:14,031 --> 00:56:16,634  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Flow Break!

588
00:56:16,634 --> 00:56:17,692  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
What?

589
00:56:34,719 --> 00:56:37,621  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
If you think you can kill
me using Living Mail,

590
00:56:37,621 --> 00:56:40,791  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
you're making a very bad mistake.

591
00:56:40,791 --> 00:56:44,161  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I didn't realize she knew Flow Break.

592
00:56:44,161 --> 00:56:45,830  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
If I'm lucky,

593
00:56:45,830 --> 00:56:48,666  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
the Enchanment of Valmasheed on
your armor has been dispelled.

594
00:56:48,666 --> 00:56:51,897  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
You don't have any chance of
winning so be prepared.

595
00:56:55,806 --> 00:56:58,542  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I wonder if you're right or not?

596
00:56:58,542 --> 00:57:03,946  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
That's it! Goldias, I'm going
to be your doom.

597
00:57:05,082 --> 00:57:06,572  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
You...

598
00:57:14,125 --> 00:57:15,717  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
You're finished.

599
00:57:26,470 --> 00:57:30,474  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Jeffrey, what are you doing here?

600
00:57:30,474 --> 00:57:32,910  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
That voice! It's Papa!

601
00:57:32,910 --> 00:57:34,468  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Papa?

602
00:57:36,747 --> 00:57:40,205  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
He's here, which means Josephine
must be here too!

603
00:57:41,619 --> 00:57:46,357  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Honey, can you explain
what's going on here?

604
00:57:46,357 --> 00:57:50,361  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Ah, well, that is, there's a long,
long story behind this, and...

605
00:57:50,361 --> 00:57:52,989  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Shut up! You wimp of a husband!

606
00:57:58,369 --> 00:57:59,631  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Mama!

607
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:07,008  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Sometimes in this world,
mysterious things happen.

608
00:58:08,112 --> 00:58:10,648  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
The wife looks like she's
not even a human,

609
00:58:10,648 --> 00:58:13,684  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
and their son is lower than
a human being.

610
00:58:13,684 --> 00:58:16,987  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I can almost understand why
that man has been

611
00:58:16,987 --> 00:58:19,790  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
committing crimes to
overcome his stress.

612
00:58:19,790 --> 00:58:21,292  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
However...

613
00:58:21,292 --> 00:58:22,092  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Stop it!

614
00:58:22,092 --> 00:58:22,893  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
*What?*
Stop it!

615
00:58:22,893 --> 00:58:23,594  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
*What?*
Please cut it out.

616
00:58:23,594 --> 00:58:24,428  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Please cut it out.

617
00:58:24,428 --> 00:58:24,895  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
*Honey, what do you want to say?*
*Honey!*
Please cut it out.

618
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:26,096  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
*Honey, what do you want to say?*
*Honey!*

619
00:58:26,096 --> 00:58:27,431  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
*Honey, what do you want to say?*
*Honey!*
Somebody, help me!

620
00:58:27,431 --> 00:58:28,466  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Somebody, help me!

621
00:58:28,466 --> 00:58:28,933  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
*Honey!*
Somebody, help me!

622
00:58:28,933 --> 00:58:30,093  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
*Honey!*

623
00:58:43,747 --> 00:58:55,793  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I don't know what to decide to do,
I picture empty skies in my dreams

624
00:58:55,793 --> 00:59:02,066  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Naze arasou no?

625
00:59:02,066 --> 00:59:07,605  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Naze kizu tsuku no?

626
00:59:07,605 --> 00:59:18,115  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Kono ude ni takusarete

627
00:59:18,115 --> 00:59:21,519  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436

628

01:03:48,619 --> 01:03:51,188  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
In the history of magic users,
there was one,

639
01:03:51,188 --> 01:03:54,555  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Shazal Rugandy, who was called great.

640
01:03:55,626 --> 01:03:58,929  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
He lived around four hundred
years ago,

641
01:03:58,929 --> 01:04:03,500  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
and had a strong talent for the
development of magical items.

642
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:05,736  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Among his many inventions,

643
01:04:05,736 --> 01:04:09,900  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
there was one called the Shadow
Reflector, a shadowy mirror.

644
01:04:15,112 --> 01:04:20,884  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
It was originally invented as a
weapon to combat evil.

645
01:04:20,884 --> 01:04:25,189  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
By reflecting a person in the mirror,
the mirror created

646
01:04:25,189 --> 01:04:30,354  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
a shadow with the same skills as
the one who was reflected.

647
01:04:32,496 --> 01:04:35,699  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
On top of that, the shadow
had a character

648
01:04:35,699 --> 01:04:39,903  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
completely opposite to that
of the reflected person.

649
01:04:39,903 --> 01:04:41,905  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
But people said that Shazard
sealed the mirror away

650
01:04:41,905 --> 01:04:44,305  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
without introducing it to the world.

651
01:04:45,943 --> 01:04:51,313  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
That's why it's existence was
treated as a rumor.

652
01:04:52,349 --> 01:04:55,319  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
That is, until recently, when a magic
user uncovered an old record.

653
01:04:55,319 --> 01:04:57,621  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
He reported the incident to the
Magic Users' Association

654
01:04:57,621 --> 01:04:59,823  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
but as the Association was
organizing the investigation,

655
01:04:59,823 --> 01:05:02,087  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
the related document was stolen
by an unidentified person.

656
01:05:03,227 --> 01:05:05,863  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
The name of the thief was
discovered soon afterwards.

657
01:05:05,863 --> 01:05:08,065  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
He's a magic user and Vice President
of the Association.

658
01:05:08,065 --> 01:05:10,067  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
His name is Lagan.

659
01:05:10,067 --> 01:05:15,334  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
His goal is obvious: to gain the
ultimate power before anybody else.

660
01:05:16,607 --> 01:05:18,575  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Think about it a second.

661
01:05:18,575 --> 01:05:23,280  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
As long as his enemy exists, by
reflecting the enemy in the mirror,

662
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:27,284  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
he will be able to create a shadow on
his side with the same abilities as

663
01:05:27,284 --> 01:05:29,419  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
his enemy, and it will be limitless.

664
01:05:29,419 --> 01:05:36,154  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Yes, even if he had only this mirror,
it would be easy to conquer the world.

665
01:05:41,398 --> 01:05:43,667  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
In order to stop his designs, the
Magic Users' Association

666
01:05:43,667 --> 01:05:45,669  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
has launched a counter plan.

667
01:05:45,669 --> 01:05:48,472  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
They've requested the cooperation
of me, Naga,

668
01:05:48,472 --> 01:05:51,675  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
as well as that of this other
one who was near me.

669
01:05:51,675 --> 01:05:54,177  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Who do you mean when you say
"this other one"?

670
01:05:54,177 --> 01:05:56,380  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
It sounds like a cover story.

671
01:05:56,380 --> 01:05:57,781  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Yes, it does.

672
01:05:57,781 --> 01:06:02,085  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
But it doesn't matter to us whether
there's a Shadow Reflector or not.

673
01:06:02,085 --> 01:06:03,587  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Why not?

674
01:06:03,587 --> 01:06:05,689  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Think about it.

675
01:06:05,689 --> 01:06:08,892  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
They've requested that we play our
part separated from the Association.

676
01:06:08,892 --> 01:06:11,995  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
We can take the mirror away from him,

677
01:06:11,995 --> 01:06:13,263  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
or destroy it,

678
01:06:13,263 --> 01:06:16,934  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
or capture Lagan, or kill him.

679
01:06:16,934 --> 01:06:18,969  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
That means...

680
01:06:18,969 --> 01:06:22,439  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
If we defeat Lagan before
the other groups,

681
01:06:22,439 --> 01:06:26,034  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
including the Association's
main group...

682
01:06:28,412 --> 01:06:31,648  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
The reward, two hundred
gold coins will be...

683
01:06:31,648 --> 01:06:34,412  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Yes, it will be ours.

684
01:06:35,719 --> 01:06:37,554  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I see.

685
01:06:37,554 --> 01:06:43,515  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Then, we're going to run straight there,
kill that magic user and get the reward!

686
01:06:51,468 --> 01:06:55,038  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I thought I heard women
laughing in here.

687
01:06:55,038 --> 01:06:58,408  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
There are only two girls
without any weapons.

688
01:06:58,408 --> 01:07:00,711  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Are you one of Lagan's followers?

689
01:07:00,711 --> 01:07:05,015  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Lagan, Lakugan, stop
talking nonsense.

690
01:07:05,015 --> 01:07:08,815  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Well, hurry-up and give me
all your valuables!

691
01:07:10,487 --> 01:07:12,148  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Explosion Array!

692
01:07:20,931 --> 01:07:22,398  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Well now...

693
01:07:23,900 --> 01:07:26,103  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
This should cover meal expenses.

694
01:07:26,103 --> 01:07:29,272  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Why don't we go now, Naga?

695
01:07:29,272 --> 01:07:32,241  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
You did it again, Lina.

696
01:07:33,910 --> 01:07:36,380  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Well, it's routine, I have to do it.

697
01:07:36,380 --> 01:07:39,042  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Now, let's go and get those
two hundred gold coins!

698
01:07:57,100 --> 01:08:01,161  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I had a dream that I was falling,
stung by disappointing news
_Shitsubou no kakera ni sasare,_
_taorete yukujibun no yume mita_

699
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:05,342  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I was shaking so hard I woke up
_Hidoku furue me ga samete_

700
01:08:05,342 --> 01:08:08,402  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
In the middle of the night,
I felt I was left alone
_Yoru no naka de tori noko_
_sareta ki ga shita_

701
01:08:09,846 --> 01:08:17,116  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I'm lonely, I feel emptiness
_Samishii yo, munashii yo_

702
01:08:24,861 --> 01:08:29,423  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
But I believe that the dream in
the real world won't die
_Keredo genjitsu no yume wa shindari_
_shinai to shinji teru yo_

703
01:08:31,234 --> 01:08:33,570  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I'm not alone if I have a friend
_Hitorija nai, nakama sae ireba_

704
01:08:33,570 --> 01:08:36,733  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I have strength to share with them
_Wakachi aeru tsuyosa ga aru kara_

705
01:08:38,208 --> 01:08:45,137  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
To share even the mistakes
or happiness
_Ayamachi mo, yorokobi mo_

706
01:08:46,316 --> 01:08:50,020  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
The mind is easily hurt
_Kokoro nan te sugu ni kizu tsuku shi_

707
01:08:50,020 --> 01:08:53,256  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
But we can start over tomorrow
_Asu ni nare ba mata de naoseru shi_

708
01:08:53,256 --> 01:09:01,131  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I won't give up my dream,
and I won't lose today
_Yume o akirame nai, kyou ni makenai_

709
01:09:01,131 --> 01:09:05,535  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
If I believe in my soul,
if I aim at the target
_lf I believe in my soul,_
_Hyouteki o mezase ba_

710
01:09:05,535 --> 01:09:09,072  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
My soul, my heartbeat becomes faster
_My soul, kodou ga hayaku naru_

711
01:09:09,072 --> 01:09:15,178  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Hot, painful, heart-rending,
my way continues
_Atsuku, itaku, setsunaku,_
_michi wa tsuzuku_

712
01:09:15,178 --> 01:09:19,683  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Everybody up down, climbing
up and falling down
_Everybody up down, nobottari ochitari_

713
01:09:19,683 --> 01:09:23,220  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Up down, but don't give up
_Up down, dakedo kujike nai de_

714
01:09:23,220 --> 01:09:30,494  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Let's change everything in our power,
run all the way
_Subete chikara ni kae yoo,_
_run all the way_

715
01:09:30,494 --> 01:09:33,830  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
The mind is easily hurt
_Kokoro nan te sugu ni kizu tsuku shi_

716
01:09:33,830 --> 01:09:37,367  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
But we can start over tomorrow
_Asu ni nare ba mata de naoseru shi_

717
01:09:37,367 --> 01:09:45,275  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I won't give up my dream,
and I won't lose today
_Yume o akirame nai, kyou ni makenai_

718
01:09:45,275 --> 01:09:49,646  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
If I believe in my soul,
if I aim at the target
_lf I believe in my soul,_
_Hyouteki o mezase ba_

719
01:09:49,646 --> 01:09:53,216  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
My soul, my heartbeat becomes faster
_My soul, kodou ga hayaku naru_

720
01:09:53,216 --> 01:09:59,356  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Hot, painful, heart-rending,
my way continues
_Atsuku, itaku, setsunaku,_
_michi wa tsuzuku_

721
01:09:59,356 --> 01:10:03,760  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Everybody up down, climbing
up and falling down
_Everybody up down, nobottari ochitari_

722
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:07,264  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Up down, but don't give up
_Up down, dakedo kujike nai de_

723
01:10:07,264 --> 01:10:17,572  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Let's change everything in our power,
run all the way
_Subete chikara ni kae yoo,_
_run all the way_

724
01:10:26,917 --> 01:10:29,909  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Oh, pretty!

725
01:10:33,490 --> 01:10:37,494  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Good, good. Hot, hot. I'm so happy!

726
01:10:37,494 --> 01:10:39,129  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Hey?

727
01:10:39,129 --> 01:10:43,433  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Good and hot! This is the way sweet
potatoes should be eaten.

728
01:10:43,433 --> 01:10:45,202  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Delicious! So delicious!

729
01:10:45,202 --> 01:10:46,236  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
*Hey!*
Delicious! So delicious!

730
01:10:46,236 --> 01:10:46,403  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
*Hey!*

731
01:10:46,403 --> 01:10:48,505  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Hot, hot!

732
01:10:48,505 --> 01:10:50,173  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Hey?!

733
01:10:50,173 --> 01:10:53,076  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
So good. You can't have it!

734
01:10:53,076 --> 01:10:54,344  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
HEY!

735
01:10:54,344 --> 01:10:58,048  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Shut up! I'm busy eating
baked sweet potato!

736
01:10:58,048 --> 01:11:01,451  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
You're also chasing Lagan, aren't you?

737
01:11:01,451 --> 01:11:03,853  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Then you ought to go back.

738
01:11:03,853 --> 01:11:09,189  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
He is protected by lycanthropes,
shape-shifters.

739
01:11:11,094 --> 01:11:12,195  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I see.

740
01:11:12,195 --> 01:11:14,664  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
There are lots of them.

741
01:11:14,664 --> 01:11:18,532  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
There were five in my group but now
they're all dead except me.

742
01:11:22,072 --> 01:11:24,908  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Oh, good, I'm done.

743
01:11:24,908 --> 01:11:26,509  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Well, see you later.

744
01:11:26,509 --> 01:11:27,911  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Hey, hey!

745
01:11:27,911 --> 01:11:29,579  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Wait, wait, wait!

746
01:11:29,579 --> 01:11:30,780  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
What now?

747
01:11:30,780 --> 01:11:32,916  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
What do you mean "what now"?

748
01:11:32,916 --> 01:11:36,519  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I'm telling you that two females
can't handle it!

749
01:11:36,519 --> 01:11:38,955  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Especially since one of
you is still sleeping.

750
01:11:38,955 --> 01:11:44,628  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
She'll be all right. After a while, she'll
come along laughing loudly.

751
01:11:44,628 --> 01:11:47,397  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Also, and actually I'm boasting,

752
01:11:47,397 --> 01:11:53,927  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
even if dozens of lycanthropes attack,
they won't be a match for us.

753
01:11:55,605 --> 01:12:00,844  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I see. Then, can you take me to the
village at the foot of this mountain?

754
01:12:00,844 --> 01:12:02,512  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
No.

755
01:12:02,512 --> 01:12:04,848  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
No?

756
01:12:04,848 --> 01:12:07,384  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
You don't have any money, do you?

757
01:12:07,384 --> 01:12:10,720  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
No, but I want you to...

758
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:13,690  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Shut up. If you want us to help you,
you need to give us

759
01:12:13,690 --> 01:12:16,526  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
something to make it worth our time.

760
01:12:16,526 --> 01:12:19,086  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I would expect you to understand
that since you're an adult.

761
01:12:21,331 --> 01:12:25,635  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I pretended to be injured and
was going to kill you

762
01:12:25,635 --> 01:12:28,905  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
when you let your guard down.

763
01:12:28,905 --> 01:12:33,610  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Good job! You've already discovered
that I'm a follower of Lord Lagan.

764
01:12:33,610 --> 01:12:35,679  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Really? I didn't know that.

765
01:12:35,679 --> 01:12:41,951  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I thought you were trying to
trick us so you could

766
01:12:41,951 --> 01:12:46,081  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
win the two hundred gold coins.

767
01:12:47,123 --> 01:12:49,826  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
You didn't recognize me?

768
01:12:49,826 --> 01:12:50,793  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
No.

769
01:12:55,832 --> 01:12:57,100  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Ah hem...

770
01:12:57,100 --> 01:13:00,592  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
In this situation, the only thing
I can do is to kill you myself.

771
01:13:04,374 --> 01:13:06,776  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
You make me laugh so hard.

772
01:13:06,776 --> 01:13:11,381  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Do you really think you can kill
me and this other one?

773
01:13:11,381 --> 01:13:13,917  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Excuse me, but who do you
mean by "this other one"?

774
01:13:13,917 --> 01:13:17,020  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
That I am injured is a lie,

775
01:13:17,020 --> 01:13:21,591  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
but the story about Lord Lagan being
protected by lycanthropes is true!

776
01:13:21,591 --> 01:13:23,259  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
No way, are you one of them?

777
01:13:23,259 --> 01:13:24,817  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Exactly!

778
01:13:39,175 --> 01:13:42,812  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Look! This is my real shape!

779
01:13:42,812 --> 01:13:45,076  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I don't want to see anything like that!

780
01:13:51,888 --> 01:13:55,016  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I guess our enemies have
prepared for us.

781
01:13:56,259 --> 01:14:01,965  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
They sure have. However, this guy
came to us, which means...

782
01:14:01,965 --> 01:14:03,400  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Perhaps...

783
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:07,437  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Yes, it means we're the top team!

784
01:14:07,437 --> 01:14:08,805  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
That means...

785
01:14:08,805 --> 01:14:11,040  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
If we keep going at the same pace...

786
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:12,803  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
If we keep going...

787
01:14:16,579 --> 01:14:17,876  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
All right!

788
01:14:19,616 --> 01:14:24,019  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
The two hundred gold coins
will be ours!

789
01:14:30,193 --> 01:14:33,963  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
In the eddying darkness, toward
the shining tomorrow
_Uzumaku yami no naka,_
_hikaru ashita ni mukai_

790
01:14:33,963 --> 01:14:35,932  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
*Fire Ball!*
ln the eddying darkness, toward
the shining tomorrow
_Uzumaku yami no naka,_
_hikaru ashita ni mukai_

791
01:14:35,932 --> 01:14:36,833  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
In the eddying darkness, toward
the shining tomorrow
_Uzumaku yami no naka,_
_hikaru ashita ni mukai_

792
01:14:36,833 --> 01:14:40,737  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
With hope of freedom but
seeking restrictions
_Jiyuu o nozomi Nahgara_
_Sokubaku o motome teru_

793
01:14:40,737 --> 01:14:42,839  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
*Freeze Arrow!*
With hope of freedom but
seeking restrictions
_Jiyuu o nozomi Nahgara_
_Sokubaku o motome teru_

794
01:14:42,839 --> 01:14:43,740  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
With hope of freedom but
seeking restrictions
_Jiyuu o nozomi Nahgara_
_Sokubaku o motome teru_

795
01:14:43,740 --> 01:14:50,480  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
To love someone, to be
loved by someone
_Hito o aisuru koto,_
_hito ni ai sareru koto_

796
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:53,450  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Getting used to wanting something,
and getting lost in loneliness
_Motomeru koto ni nare te,_
_sabishisa ni mayotte iru_

797
01:14:53,450 --> 01:14:55,785  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
*Garb Flair!*
Getting used to wanting something,
and getting lost in loneliness
_Motomeru koto ni nare te,_
_sabishisa ni mayotte iru_

798
01:14:55,785 --> 01:14:57,987  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Getting used to wanting something,
and getting lost in loneliness
_Motomeru koto ni nare te,_
_sabishisa ni mayotte iru_

799
01:14:57,987 --> 01:15:03,993  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Human meets human, and
becomes human
_Hito wa hito ni deai,_
_hajimete hito ni naru_

800
01:15:03,993 --> 01:15:11,201  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Meeting at this moment is
not a coincidence
_lma aeta koto wa, guuzenja nai kara_

801
01:15:11,201 --> 01:15:17,807  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
If you want to become strong,
if you want to become kind
_Tsuyoku naritai nara,_
_yasashiku naritai nara_

802
01:15:17,807 --> 01:15:23,813  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Take good care of yourself,
more and more
_Motto, Motto, jibun o taisetsu ni shite_

803
01:15:23,813 --> 01:15:31,554  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
If you want to know why you were
born, if you want kindness
_Umareta wake o shiritai nara,_
_yasashiku shite hoshii nara_

804
01:15:31,554 --> 01:15:38,528  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
You can love someone on your
own, more and more
_Motto, motto, jubun kara aiseba ii_

805
01:15:38,528 --> 01:15:45,068  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
When you get hurt, when
you hate yourself
_Kizu tsuita toki koso,_
_jibun ga iya na toki koso_

806
01:15:45,068 --> 01:15:51,608  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I'm sure you'll be able
to find tomorrow
_Kitto, kitto, hito wa asu o mitsukeru_

807
01:15:51,608 --> 01:15:55,512  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
It's okay to stop and have a rest
_Tach-domatte yasumu no mo ii_

808
01:15:55,512 --> 01:15:58,982  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Until the day when you can
start to walk again
_Mata aruki daseru hi made_

809
01:15:58,982 --> 01:16:06,115  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I'm sure that the time
will come soon
_Kitto, kitto, sono toki wa_
_mou sugu soko_

810
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:15,920  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Fire Ball!

811
01:16:31,347 --> 01:16:33,315  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
You started a fire.

812
01:16:44,961 --> 01:16:49,227  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Please, please, please, please...

813
01:16:58,474 --> 01:17:00,143  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
We've finally reached their hide-out!

814
01:17:00,143 --> 01:17:01,508  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Two hundred gold coins!

815
01:18:28,698 --> 01:18:32,268  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
The dogs from the Association have
finally arrived, have they?

816
01:18:32,268 --> 01:18:37,296  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
However, it's already too late!
Look at this!

817
01:18:51,521 --> 01:18:56,025  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
This is the legendary mirror,
Shadow Reflector!

818
01:18:56,025 --> 01:18:57,827  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Shadow Reflector?

819
01:18:57,827 --> 01:18:59,529  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
The Mirror of the Shadows...

820
01:18:59,529 --> 01:19:02,598  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I can't believe it really exists.

821
01:19:02,598 --> 01:19:08,204  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
But there is no guarantee that the one
you have in your hands isn't a fake.

822
01:19:08,204 --> 01:19:12,208  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Exactly. That's why I've
been waiting for you.

823
01:19:12,208 --> 01:19:14,310  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Waiting for you to come here.

824
01:19:14,310 --> 01:19:19,009  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Now, I can determine if this mirror
is genuine or a fake.

825
01:19:20,583 --> 01:19:22,050  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Let's find out!

826
01:20:06,763 --> 01:20:09,065  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I did it! I did it!

827
01:20:09,065 --> 01:20:13,399  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Look! I finally have the ultimate power!

828
01:20:23,679 --> 01:20:25,943  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
The legendary mirror really exists.

829
01:20:27,083 --> 01:20:28,985  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
If the rest of legend is right,

830
01:20:28,985 --> 01:20:32,088  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
the shadows have the same
knowledge and experience,

831
01:20:32,088 --> 01:20:34,290  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
they are the same level as we are.

832
01:20:34,290 --> 01:20:38,661  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
The definite difference is, as long
as we are Lagan's enemies,

833
01:20:38,661 --> 01:20:40,696  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
the shadows will be Lagan's allies,

834
01:20:40,696 --> 01:20:44,567  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
which means they are our enemies.

835
01:20:44,567 --> 01:20:46,728  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I was careless, but...

836
01:20:48,604 --> 01:20:52,335  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
You're impressed, aren't you?
Well, here are the shadows!

837
01:20:58,181 --> 01:21:04,142  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Kill your enemy in front of you.
Fight! Fight against yourselves!

838
01:21:11,894 --> 01:21:13,384  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Are they really attacking us?

839
01:21:16,432 --> 01:21:18,900  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
What the hell do they want to do?

840
01:21:23,739 --> 01:21:25,798  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Please, let's talk to each other.

841
01:21:30,446 --> 01:21:32,710  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
What? What?

842
01:21:33,950 --> 01:21:36,578  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Boo hoo, boo hoo...

843
01:21:39,889 --> 01:21:43,450  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Hey, I said "fight"!

844
01:21:45,027 --> 01:21:48,019  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Fight? How barbarous!

845
01:21:52,335 --> 01:21:56,038  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Even if we call each other "enemy",
we're all human beings.

846
01:21:56,038 --> 01:21:59,809  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
There are no really bad
people in the world.

847
01:21:59,809 --> 01:22:02,912  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
If we talk, I'm sure you'll understand.

848
01:22:02,912 --> 01:22:05,881  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Right? You will understand me,
won't you?

849
01:22:10,253 --> 01:22:12,278  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Goose pimples, goose pimples!

850
01:22:33,409 --> 01:22:38,574  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I never imagined how scary I'd be if
I were feminine and a humanitarian.

851
01:22:39,916 --> 01:22:42,578  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Then what's happening to Naga?

852
01:22:45,354 --> 01:22:48,551  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I cant' wear an outfit like this!

853
01:22:51,761 --> 01:22:52,819  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Here!

854
01:22:55,998 --> 01:22:58,558  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Let go! No...

855
01:23:07,476 --> 01:23:10,179  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
How scary the Shadow Reflector is!

856
01:23:10,179 --> 01:23:14,884  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
It is truly worthy of being called
the ultimate weapon.

857
01:23:14,884 --> 01:23:17,119  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Well, how can I put this...

858
01:23:17,119 --> 01:23:20,222  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
This isn't quite what I expected.

859
01:23:20,222 --> 01:23:23,326  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
What shall we do, Lord Lagan?

860
01:23:23,326 --> 01:23:27,530  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
You ask what we should do,
but in this situation...

861
01:23:27,530 --> 01:23:29,122  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
What can I say?

862
01:23:30,466 --> 01:23:36,305  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Now I know why Shazal Rugandy
sealed that mirror away.

863
01:23:36,305 --> 01:23:41,110  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Even if this mirror creates peaceful
shadows of a hostile enemy,

864
01:23:41,110 --> 01:23:45,214  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
nothing would be changed.

865
01:23:45,214 --> 01:23:47,183  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
It will be a waste to break it,

866
01:23:47,183 --> 01:23:49,185  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
but more importantly,

867
01:23:49,185 --> 01:23:52,154  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
it's just to embarrassing
to leave it loose!

868
01:23:52,154 --> 01:23:54,757  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Embarrassing to leave it loose...

869
01:23:54,757 --> 01:23:57,360  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
*Embarrassing to leave it loose...*

870
01:23:57,360 --> 01:23:59,962  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
For the time being,
I'm going to run away!

871
01:23:59,962 --> 01:24:02,198  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Excuse me, but what about these?

872
01:24:02,198 --> 01:24:03,632  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Leave them!

873
01:24:03,632 --> 01:24:05,361  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Hey, I won't let you escape!

874
01:24:08,337 --> 01:24:13,075  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Please wait. What are you going
to do to Lord Lagan?

875
01:24:13,075 --> 01:24:15,211  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Are you asking me?

876
01:24:15,211 --> 01:24:18,214  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
It's obvious! I going to beat him up
and take him to the Association!

877
01:24:18,214 --> 01:24:20,983  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Even if I tell her that, she'll
just keep hold of me,

878
01:24:20,983 --> 01:24:24,220  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
and I'm sure she'll continue to
talk about human rights

879
01:24:24,220 --> 01:24:28,281  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
or the need to talk or something
like that forever.

880
01:24:30,126 --> 01:24:31,560  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Ms. Lina!

881
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:34,196  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I understand. Let's talk.

882
01:24:34,196 --> 01:24:36,098  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Really?

883
01:24:36,098 --> 01:24:37,360  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Boo hoo...

884
01:24:38,434 --> 01:24:40,970  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
It's working! I'm pretending
I'm an easy going person

885
01:24:40,970 --> 01:24:43,438  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
but actually I'm combating
her just by talking.

886
01:24:45,174 --> 01:24:46,409  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Listen carefully.

887
01:24:46,409 --> 01:24:48,911  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Lagan stole a document which
belongs to the Association,

888
01:24:48,911 --> 01:24:52,815  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
and he plotted to keep the
Shadow Reflector to himself.

889
01:24:52,815 --> 01:24:54,250  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Oh, no...

890
01:24:54,250 --> 01:24:55,551  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
It's true.

891
01:24:55,551 --> 01:25:01,724  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
People from the Association will arrive
soon, and show you the evidence.

892
01:25:01,724 --> 01:25:04,460  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
You'll understand the situation by
hearing the story from them.

893
01:25:04,460 --> 01:25:06,362  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Anyway, he has to expiate his guilt.

894
01:25:06,362 --> 01:25:08,057  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
But...

895
01:25:14,837 --> 01:25:17,606  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I know you're on Lagan's side,

896
01:25:17,606 --> 01:25:20,910  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
but, yes, that's why you have
a responsibility to make him

897
01:25:20,910 --> 01:25:23,279  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
understand he has to pay!

898
01:25:23,279 --> 01:25:26,043  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I understand it will be hard for you,
but this is for him.

899
01:25:29,185 --> 01:25:30,652  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
You're right!

900
01:25:31,854 --> 01:25:34,723  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Now that you've decided to do so,
let's hurry up and chase him!

901
01:25:34,723 --> 01:25:38,682  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Hey, Naga, stop passing out again
and again and come with us!

902
01:25:40,429 --> 01:25:41,831  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Hey, hurry up!

903
01:25:41,831 --> 01:25:44,133  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
All right.

904
01:25:44,133 --> 01:25:49,004  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Excuse me, but shall I go with you?

905
01:25:49,004 --> 01:25:50,972  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I'm embarrassed to stay
here by myself.

906
01:26:01,984 --> 01:26:03,786  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I wonder which way he went?

907
01:26:03,786 --> 01:26:05,651  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
They ran pretty fast, didn't they?

908
01:26:09,825 --> 01:26:12,228  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I guess Lagan and the others
came across

909
01:26:12,228 --> 01:26:14,930  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
the other group from the
Association somewhere.

910
01:26:14,930 --> 01:26:16,090  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I'd guess so.

911
01:26:19,969 --> 01:26:24,340  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Damn! The Association shouldn't
waste my time!

912
01:26:24,340 --> 01:26:26,275  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
The mirror is okay though.

913
01:26:26,275 --> 01:26:27,708  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Lord Lagan!

914
01:26:30,713 --> 01:26:34,114  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
No way! Why is the shadow
helping you?!

915
01:26:35,684 --> 01:26:37,486  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Please!

916
01:26:37,486 --> 01:26:42,825  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Lord Lagan, stop doing scary
things like this, I beg you.

917
01:26:42,825 --> 01:26:46,462  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Surely, I respect you and love you,

918
01:26:46,462 --> 01:26:48,631  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
but guilt is guilt.

919
01:26:48,631 --> 01:26:52,067  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Please, please throw your
weapon away!

920
01:26:54,837 --> 01:26:58,603  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
If the shadow, which has an opposite
character is like this...

921
01:27:02,211 --> 01:27:05,080  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
You, what kind of character
do you have then?!

922
01:27:05,080 --> 01:27:06,342  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
None of your business!

923
01:27:07,783 --> 01:27:11,353  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
That's okay. However, no matter
who's trying to catch me,

924
01:27:11,353 --> 01:27:13,355  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I'm going to run away and
never be caught.

925
01:27:13,355 --> 01:27:16,392  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
That's why I brought this
mirror with me.

926
01:27:16,392 --> 01:27:19,028  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
If I create the enemy's shadow,
even if the shadow doesn't

927
01:27:19,028 --> 01:27:21,630  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
have the will to fight, it can be
used as a speed bump.

928
01:27:21,630 --> 01:27:25,701  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Lycanthropes, attack them!
Attack them and kill them!

929
01:27:25,701 --> 01:27:26,702  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I'm there!

930
01:27:26,702 --> 01:27:29,772  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I'm going to be with him until the end.

931
01:27:29,772 --> 01:27:31,707  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
No! Don't!

932
01:27:31,707 --> 01:27:33,409  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
How shameful...

933
01:27:33,409 --> 01:27:35,978  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
What are you going to do
about those two?

934
01:27:35,978 --> 01:27:40,316  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I think the shadows will disappear
once the mirror is broken.

935
01:27:40,316 --> 01:27:43,519  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Let's break the mirror
during the battle!

936
01:27:43,519 --> 01:27:45,221  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I guess that's the only choice for us.

937
01:27:45,221 --> 01:27:46,483  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Well, let's go!

938
01:27:48,557 --> 01:27:50,320  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Freeze Arrow!

939
01:27:55,030 --> 01:27:56,156  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Bram Braizer!

940
01:28:27,229 --> 01:28:28,389  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
It's over.

941
01:28:31,900 --> 01:28:34,368  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Everything's over, finally.

942
01:28:36,038 --> 01:28:37,740  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Excuse me...

943
01:28:37,740 --> 01:28:40,442  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Well, you had no choice, but...

944
01:28:40,442 --> 01:28:42,244  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I don't want to accept...

945
01:28:42,244 --> 01:28:45,948  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I don't like you using violence.

946
01:28:45,948 --> 01:28:48,550  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I don't want to accept...

947
01:28:48,550 --> 01:28:52,509  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Because we really don't like violence.

948
01:28:53,922 --> 01:28:55,991  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
No...

949
01:28:55,991 --> 01:28:57,151  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
NO!

950
01:29:00,195 --> 01:29:03,699  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
After all, the Shadow Reflector
has been broken into pieces,

951
01:29:03,699 --> 01:29:07,870  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Naga and I captured Lagan,
gave him to the Association

952
01:29:07,870 --> 01:29:11,307  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
and got the two hundred gold coins.

953
01:29:11,307 --> 01:29:14,376  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Even though the mirror was broken,
the shadows haven't disappeared.

954
01:29:14,376 --> 01:29:16,712  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Nobody knows why they
haven't disappeared.

955
01:29:16,712 --> 01:29:19,977  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
But what has happened
to the shadows?

956
01:29:24,119 --> 01:29:29,491  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
You're the girls I met a little
while ago, aren't you?

957
01:29:29,491 --> 01:29:32,895  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
I underestimated you because
you're girls.

958
01:29:32,895 --> 01:29:35,130  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
But I won't make that mistake again!

959
01:29:35,130 --> 01:29:39,590  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Now, give me twice the amount of
money as last time!

960
01:29:46,175 --> 01:29:47,142  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
No...

961
01:29:52,648 --> 01:29:56,285  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
If you see them somewhere,
just forget about it

962
01:29:56,285 --> 01:29:59,054  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
and say you didn't see
anybody, please.

963
01:29:59,054 --> 01:30:01,522  X1:050 X2:669 Y1:234 Y2:436
Please!
