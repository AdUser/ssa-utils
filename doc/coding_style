In project used mixed coding style, but commonly looks-like 'gnu' style.
Indent - two space, not tab. Indent does as for curly braces, as for code
in them. Logical blocks of code separates from each other by one blank line.
Some examples as mini howto:

char *
function(args, ...)
  {
    char *p = NULL; /* all variables must be initialized *
    int i = 0;       * in this block, or right below it  */

    if (some_flag)
      {
        /* do some actions */
        for (i = 0; i < 3; i++) /* note: spaces between operators */
          action();
       /* ^ note: for only one instruction, *
        * i prefer not to use curly braces  */

        some_flag = 0x0;
      }

    return NULL;
  }
     /* <- blank line here (as separator) */
